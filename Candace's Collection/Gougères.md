# Gougères

Origin: Unknown, ....not quite sure if grandma's handwriting?

## Ingredints

- 1/2 c whole milk
- 1/2 c water
- 8 Tb butter - cut into 4 pieces
- 1/2 t salt
- 1 c flour
- 5 lg eggs, at room temp
- 1 1/2 c grated cheese (gruyère or cheddar)

## Directions

Position oven racks to divide oven in thirds & preheat to 425˚. Live 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, set aside. Bring the milk, water, butter, and salt to a rapid boil in a heavy bottomed med. saucepan over high heat. Add the flour all at once, lower the heat to medium-low and immediately start stirring energetically with a wooden spoon or heavy whisk. The dough wil come together and a light crust will form on the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring - with vigor - for another minute or 2 to dry the dough. The dough should no be very smooth.

Turn the dough into the bowl of a mixer fitte witht he paddle attachment or into a bowl that you can use for mixing with a hand mixer or a wooden spoon and elbow grease. Let the dough sit for a minute, then add the eggs one by one and beat, beat, beat until the dough is thick and shiny. Make sure that each egg is completely incorporated before you add the next, and don't be concerned if the dough separates  by teh time the last egg goes in, the dough will come together again. Beat in the grated cheese. Once the dough is made, it should be spooned out immediately.

Using about 1 Tb of dough for each gougère, drop the dough from a spoon onto the lined baking sheets, leaving about 2" of "puff space" between the mounds.

Slide the baking sheets into the oven and immediately turn the oven temp down to 375˚ F. Bake for 12 min, then rotate the pans from front to back and top to bottom. Continue baking until the gougères are golden, firm & puffed (another 12 - 15 min). Serve warm, or cooled.
