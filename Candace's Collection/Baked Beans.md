## Directions

Add ingredients in uncovered deep dish and bake at 235 degrees for 2-1/2 hours. Makes 6-8 servings.

You can add the onions to the original amount of beans. If you add molasses and don't increase the beans, then cut back 1/2 of both the molasses and the brown sugar.

If not increasing the beans, you can sub the canned deviled ham for the bacon.
