# Peg's Cake

Origin: Apparently Peg. Grandma's handwriting, though it looks rather different than normal. I would guess that she wrote it as a child? Also, this cake looks nearly identical to the cake from Juanita, whose name I couldn't make out.

## Ingredients and Directions

Into a bowl, put

- 1 package yellow cake mix (about 1 pound, 3 ounces)
- 1 package instant vanilla pudding (about 4 ounces)
- 4 eggs (don't bother to beat them)
- 3/4 cup salad oil
- 3/4 cup sherry
- 1 tsp nutmeg

Now beat it all for 5 minutes at medium speed. Pour it into a greased 10-inch tube cake or mold, and bake it 45 minutes at 350Ëš.
