# Grandma Margaret Engel's Recipes

In which I go through my grandmother's recipe book looking for handwritten, family recipes.  Her mother and grandparents immigrated to the United States in 1911 from England and some of her recipes reflect this origin.  For example, kedgeree, lemon curd, and some of the frostings.  More specifically:

- Danish Quick Cake
- Granny's Christmas Cake
- Mom's Chocolate Cookies


Many others are very 1950s and 60s, to my eyes.

In general, I made the following editorial decisions:

- somewhat standardized ingredient amounts
- transcribed directions as written
- added names to the titles where the source was known
- left recipes in whichever category they were originally placed
