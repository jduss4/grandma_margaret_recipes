# Date Bread

Origin: Unknown, grandma's handwriting, but on a card that says "A recipe from the heart of Nebraska"

It's possible this is from when her family originally lived in Omaha, NE, but I suspect it is more likely to have been from her last 20 some years in Nebraska.

## Ingredients and Directions

Mix together & set aside to cool

- 2 cups dates, chopped
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1 tsp bkg. soda
- 2 cups sugar

Cream sugar & butter. Add eggs. Add flour & dry ingredients alternately with date mixture.

- 2 cups sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 4 cups flour

(I mix the dry ingredients & date mixture in with a spoon.)

Grease 2 large loaf pans. Bake 50˚min or [50?] at 350˚.

Remove from pans right away & cool on wire rack.
