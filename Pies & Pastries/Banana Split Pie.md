# Banana Split Pie

Origin: Nelle Morgan, grandma's handwriting

## Ingredients

- 1 - 9" Graham Cracker Crust
- 1 - can Eagle Brand condensed milk
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 1 small can crushed pineapple (drained)
- 2 sliced bananas

## Directions

Mix Eagle Brand Milk & lemon juice. Add drained pineapple & sliced bananas. Pour into pie shell. Top with Cool Whip to serve.

Sliced __strawberries__ can be layered in when they are in season.

I also like to sprinkle __chopped nuts__ over the Cool Whip.
