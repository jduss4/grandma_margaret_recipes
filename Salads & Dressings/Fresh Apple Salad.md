Origin: National Grange Bicentennial Cookbook, typewritten
In Candace's collection of grandma's cards, there is a recipe card which attributes this recipe to "Pat Dussault," my other grandma.

## Ingredients

- 2 - 3 red Delicious apples, diced (do not peel)
- lemon juice
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 cup diced oranges
- 1 cup diced pinapple [sic]
- 1/2 cup green seedless grapes, halved
- 1/2 cup currants, raisin or dates (optional)
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans)
- 1 whole banana sliced

## Directions

Dice enough apples to make four cups. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Toss with rest of items. Add enough Cream Cheese Dressing to coat well just before serving.

## Cream Cheese Dressing

- 1  3 oz package cream cheese softened
- 2-3 Tb pineapple juice
- 1 cup whipping ceeam [sic], whipped
- Confectioner's sugar to taste (opt)

Beat cream cheese until fluffy, beat in juice. Fold in whipped cream and small amt of sugar, if desired. Will keep several days in refrig.

(note:) I didn't hvae whipping cream so I added about 1/4 cup of Mayonaise [sic] and I substituted Don's Equal sweetner [sic] for the sugar. (2 packets.)
